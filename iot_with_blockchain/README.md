IoT with Blockchain DEMO
-----------------------------
The ODIN(Open Data Index Name) is built on Bitcoin blockchain  and other blockchains such as factcom, ethereum.
It is Open Source. It is a bit like DNS, but support more valuable features by using blockchain.     

Open Hybrid is a platform for interaction with everyday objects which is developed by MIT.
It combines physical objects with the benefits of a flexible augmented user interface.
It is Open Source and based on Web-Technology and Arduino.

This demo try to show the advantage by merging ODIN/Blockchain and OpenHybrid together , which would push forward the big pop of smart things. 

The source directory:
OBJECT: the source code runinng on the smart device.  
API: The cloud API for parsing ODINs .
APP: The android app for demo

基于区块链的开放标识系统与智能硬件的结合演示案例
-------------------------------------------------------
基于区块链建立的PPk ODIN开放命名标识可以很好地被用作智能硬件的身份标识，与MIT发布的OpenHybrid开源物联网平台架构结合可以很方便地将分散的智能硬件“connect”构成一个自组网、可个性化编程的有机整体，并提供一个“所见即所控”、直观统一的AR使用界面，有望推动物联网和智能设备真正爆发。
